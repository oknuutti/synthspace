# synthspace

## setup

Install by:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/oknuutti/synthspace.git
```

Please note that this is just an interface for image rendering functionality buried in `https://github.com/oknuutti/visnav-py`. Pip installs all dependencies of that project and they are quite extensive. However, only small part of them is really needed by the rendering functionality that this interface project accesses.
